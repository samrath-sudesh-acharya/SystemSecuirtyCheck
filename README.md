The project will begin with a thorough analysis of the current threat landscape and an assessment of existing cybersecurity measures within the target organization. This evaluation will identify vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and areas requiring immediate attention. Based on this analysis, a multi-layered cybersecurity strategy will be devised, incorporating the following key components:

[1] A Scanner and Banner Extractor: Open Port Scanner <br/>
[2] An Anti-virus Tool: Virus Scan <br/>
[3] A Man In The Middle Attack Detector: MIME <br/>
[4] Present Security Checking Tool: Windows Firewall Rules Checker <br/>

# System Design

With the help of the Multithreading ability of the `python` language, we built an executable. When the executable file is downloaded and run the system fetches the information from the user system. The data collected can be viewed by the user with the help of a website that accesses the data from `MongoDB`.
